## Description:

NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.5 is an open foundation model for generalized humanoid robot reasoning and skills. This cross-embodiment model takes multimodal input, including language and images, to perform manipulation tasks in diverse environments. Developers and researchers can post-train GR00T N1.5 with real or synthetic data for their specific humanoid robot or task.<br><br>
Isaac `GR00T N1.5-3B` is the medium-sized version of our model built using pre-trained vision and language encoders, and uses a flow matching action transformer to model a chunk of actions conditioned on vision, language and proprioception.<br><br>
This model is ready for non-commercial use.

## Model Architecture:
**Architecture Type:** Vision Transformer, Multilayer Perceptron, Flow matching Transformer

Isaac GR00T N1.5 uses vision and text transformers to encode the robot's image observations and text instructions. The architecture handles a varying number of views per embodiment by concatenating image token embeddings from all frames into a sequence, followed by language token embeddings. 

To model proprioception and a sequence of actions conditioned on observations, Isaac GR00T N1.5-3B uses a flow matching transformer. The flow matching transformer interleaves self-attention over proprioception and actions with cross-attention to the vision and language embeddings. During training, the input actions are corrupted by randomly interpolating between the clean action vector and a gaussian noise vector. At inference time, the policy first samples a gaussian noise vector and iteratively reconstructs a continuous-value action using its velocity prediction.

In GR00T-N1.5, the MLP connector between the vision-language features and the diffusion-transformer (DiT) has been modified for improved performance on our sim benchmarks. Also, it was trained jointly with flow matching and world-modeling objectives.

**Network Architecture:** 
![image/png](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/blob/main/media/model-architecture.png?raw=true)
The schematic diagram is shown in the illustration above.
Red, Green, Blue (RGB) camera frames are processed through a pre-trained vision transformer (SigLip2).
Text is encoded by a pre-trained transformer (T5)
Robot proprioception is encoded using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) indexed by the embodiment ID. To handle variable-dimension proprio, inputs are padded to a configurable max length before feeding into the MLP.
Actions are encoded and velocity predictions decoded by an MLP, one per unique embodiment.
The flow matching transformer is implemented as a diffusion transformer (DiT), in which the diffusion step conditioning is implemented using adaptive layernorm (AdaLN).
